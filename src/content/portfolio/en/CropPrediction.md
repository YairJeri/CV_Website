Crop Prediction is a machine learning project that helps farmers select the most suitable crops based on soil properties and climate conditions. The project leverages models like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Sequential Neural Networks to provide accurate recommendations and support sustainable agriculture.

## Features
- **Predict Crop Type:** Input soil and climate variables to get crop recommendations.
- **Multiple Models:** Compare predictions from Random Forest, KNN, and Neural Networks.
- **Interactive Inputs:** Users can specify N, P, K levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.
- **Sustainable Recommendations:** Supports farmers in maximizing yield while minimizing resource misuse.  
  

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, KNN)
- TensorFlow / Keras (Sequential Neural Network)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
